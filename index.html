    Ceptre Editor is a web-based program for creating prototypes for games in a conceptual level; it was made as a
    quicker and more direct way of making experimental game mechanics, without having to code more specific details
    that the person might not be interested in making at the moment.
    <br />
    <br />
    The Ceptre Editor allows you to build a world and the elements that exist in said world, as well as manipulate how
    these elements will act and interact with each other. This allows users to be able to start creating a base or a
    skeleton of a game and see if the mechanics would be possible or what problems arise when trying to make it and,
    if possible, correct them.
    <br />
    <br />
    <br />
    It works by looking for arguments that are true in the world and allow the user to execute certain actions
    accordingly. The same way that many games can be boiled down to a handful of rules and goals, the Ceptre allows
    developers to discern whether the game that they are conceptualizing could have important pitfalls that they would
    need to avoid.
